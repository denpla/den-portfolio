    "summary": "I'm a dedicated and experienced telecommunication engineer within a total 16 years of experience of which 10 years in GSM and 6 years in fixed networks. In 1990 I fell in love with seeing a PC for the first time in my life. Here my passion for the IT industry began and so I've started my career in technical support in telecom. I was a specialist in PC hardware, designing, layout making, and system administrating. In 2020 I've decided to gain new skills and boost my career joining the training for Front-End Developing in the IT school INTEC Brussels. Currently, I'm looking for opportunities where I can further upgrade my programming skills and new horizons open up for me in the area of Front-End and possibly BackEnd development.",
